# NLP_Labs
This repository serves as a collection of my hands-on experiments and projects in the field of NLP. Each lab focuses on fundamental and advanced NLP techniques, providing a practical understanding of how to process, analyze, and derive insights from text data.

## What's Inside?
### Basic Text Processing:

Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

Text normalization and cleaning techniques.

### Text Classification:

Building and evaluating models for sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic classification.

Exploring traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

Implementing RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs for sequence modeling tasks.

Applications in text generation and sequence prediction.

### Word Embeddings:

Understanding and implementing word2vec, GloVe, and FastText.

Visualizing and interpreting word vectors.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER):

Building models to identify and classify entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) in text.

Exploring rule-based and machine learning-based approaches.

### Technologies and Tools Used:
Python

Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

Jupyter Notebooks for interactive experimentation

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
